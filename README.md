# Gemini
> Mythology of the constellation Gemini. This zodiacal constellation represents the twins Castor and Polydeuces.
## Project Description
Mobile app that scans websites for designer item "look alikes" instead of the real expensive deal. Offers tiers for how cheap you wanna go. For example, a designer shoe might cost $400, but you can find a look alike for $100 or $40.    

## The MVP
> Gemini, by the end of the development process should open to a homepage of items to buy with their expensive counterpart. In the search bar there will be an camera icon allowing reverse image searching. Top page, your page (where you'd save items), a page for sharing items people have bought.

## Milestones
Milestones include:
- Ability to search and retrieve Designer/Knock-Off-Items
- Reverse Image Searching
- Ability to buy from the app instead of being directed to the company’s site

## Stretch Goals
- Point System for retailers
- Reviews from users
- Ensure that the items are coming from real retailers, verified accounts?
- Sell your own items like Depop?
- Outfit generation/Suggestion based off of what you’ve bought.

##### Here are some ideas:
* [React Native] - component based frame work, prevents boilerplating!
* [Flutter] - Flutter is Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
* [Firebase] - Integrates easily with both Flutter and React.
* [Android Studio] - You should know why.
* [git] - Pretty terminal. (Here is a [cheat sheet])
* Tensorflow - Image Recognition
